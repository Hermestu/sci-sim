    The mayor of Katzville has reached out to you for help because you are an epidemiologist. An epidemiologist is a scientist who studies what makes people unhealthy. Sometimes epidemiologists are called disease detectives because they figure out why people are unhealthy or sick and how to make them feel better. <br />

    The mayor of Katzville wants you to come in and put your skills to test. You will visit Katzville and meet with the residents. Your goals are to: <br /><br />

    1. Identify the resident’s health problems<br />
    2. Determine why the residents have these health problems<br />

    You will examine each person to determine what what health problems they have and why. After you have finished collecting data, you will make a recommendation to the mayor of Katzville.
